Dagger 2 Overrides Examples
===========================

This project tries to show some alternative approaches to achieve overriden dependency bindings with Dagger 2 as it was possible to do with Dagger 1.

It is a plain Java 8 project with a Gradle configuration. It can be easily compiled using Gradle and it also contains a sample console program on the Application class.
